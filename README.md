# **Data Orchestration for Financial Data**

## **Overview**

Data orchestration is the process of automating and managing data-related activities such as **ingestion**, **transformation**, and **quality checks**. Instead of manually writing ETL scripts, data orchestration tools collect, organize, and structure data, making it readily accessible to analytics platforms. This strategy focuses on using orchestration tools like **Apache Airflow**, **Azure Data Factory**, and **Prefect** to build scalable and efficient data pipelines.

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this strategy is to automate, schedule, and manage workflows for financial data pipelines. This includes automating the extraction, transformation, and quality assurance of data using the latest orchestration tools. The orchestration ensures that data pipelines run in a **timely**, **reliable**, and **scalable** manner, providing high-quality data for reporting, analysis, and decision-making.

## **1. Tool Selection and Environment Setup**

### **1a. Tool Selection**

- **Apache Airflow**: Ideal for complex workflows that require Python-based DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) with multiple dependencies. It provides excellent flexibility for defining tasks and managing dependencies.
  
- **Azure Data Factory**: Best for cloud-based, large-scale ETL processes, especially within the Azure ecosystem. It supports both ETL and ELT and is suitable for hybrid data environments.
  
- **Prefect**: A modern orchestration platform that offers a flexible, Python-native experience. Prefect is well-suited for cloud-native, lightweight orchestration tasks.

### **1b. Environment Setup**

Once the tool is selected, ensure the following:

- **Configuration**: Set up secure connections to source systems such as APIs, databases (e.g., PostgreSQL), and cloud storage.
  
- **Monitoring**: Implement logging, error handling, and real-time notifications for workflow execution status.
  
- **Security**: Use secure authentication methods such as API tokens or OAuth to ensure data integrity and access control.

## **2. Data Orchestration Workflows**

### **2a. Data Ingestion**

**Goal**: Automate the extraction of financial data from multiple sources like the **SEC EDGAR API**, internal databases, and cloud storage.

#### **Key Steps**:

- **Source Connection**: Configure connections to APIs and databases (e.g., PostgreSQL).
  
- **Data Ingestion Pipeline**: Create pipelines to ingest data in various formats (JSON, CSV, XML) at regular intervals (real-time or scheduled).
  
- **Parallel Execution**: Utilize parallel task execution to process data from multiple sources simultaneously.

#### **Example**:

- For financial statements, use the **SEC EDGAR XBRL API** to pull quarterly and annual reports (10-Q, 10-K) for selected companies.
  
- Ingest SEC filings metadata and financial data into a centralized data warehouse for further processing.

### **2b. Data Transformation**

**Goal**: Convert raw ingested data into structured formats suitable for analysis and reporting.

#### **Key Steps**:

- **Cleaning and Standardization**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats (e.g., date, currency).
  
- **Data Enrichment**: Integrate metadata (e.g., company details, industry sectors) with financial datasets for better insights.
  
- **Schema Mapping**: Transform data into predefined schemas (e.g., Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) based on the **Data Catalogue** and **Data Dictionary**.
  
- **Aggregation**: Aggregate data by fiscal periods or sectors for historical analysis and forecasting.

---

### **2c. Data Quality (DQ) Checks**

**Goal**: Ensure the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the ingested and transformed data.

#### **Key Steps**:

- **Validation**: Run checks on critical fields like financial metrics (revenues, profits) to ensure values are within expected ranges.
  
- **Completeness**: Verify that all required data points (e.g., filing dates, company identifiers) are ingested correctly.
  
- **Consistency**: Ensure uniformity across datasets by validating formats, units (e.g., USD, shares), and naming conventions.

## **Conclusion**

This data orchestration strategy outlines a comprehensive approach to automating the ingestion, transformation, and validation of financial data. By leveraging tools like **Apache Airflow**, **Azure Data Factory**, and **Prefect**, we ensure that data pipelines are reliable, scalable, and capable of delivering high-quality insights in real-time.
