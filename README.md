The **Data orchestration** is a method or a tool that manages data-related activities. Instead of creating ETL scripts data orchestration tool collect and organize the data making it readily accessible to analytics tools.

# Data Orchestration Strategy for Financial Data

Objective
The goal of this data orchestration strategy is to define an approach for automating, scheduling, and managing data workflows such as data ingestion, data transformation, and data quality checks. Using orchestration tools like Airflow, Azure Data Factory, or Prefect, the strategy ensures timely, reliable, and scalable data pipeline execution.

1a. **Tool Selection and Environment Setup**: Apache Airflow: Best suited for complex, Python-based DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) workflows with multiple dependencies.

1b. **Environment Setup**: Ensure the chosen orchestration tool is properly configured with appropriate connections to source systems, databases, and APIs.
Set up logging, error handling, and notification mechanisms for monitoring and alerting on pipeline execution status.

2 **Data Orchestration Workflows**:

2a: ### **Data Ingestion**
    Automate the extraction of data from various sources (e.g., SEC EDGAR API, internal databases)

Key Steps:

- Source Connection: Configure connections to APIs, databases (Postgres).
- Data Ingestion Pipeline: Create pipelines to ingest data in various formats (JSON, CSV, XML) at regular intervals, such as real-time or scheduled daily updates.
- Parallel Execution: Use parallel task execution to handle multiple data sources simultaneously.

Example:

-   For financial statements, use SEC EDGARâ€™s XBRL API to pull quarterly and annual reports (10-Q, 10-K) for selected companies.
-   Ingest SEC filings metadata and financial data into a centralized data warehouse for further processing.

2b. **Data Transformation**
Goal: Convert raw ingested data into structured formats suitable for analysis and reporting.

- Cleaning and Standardization: Apply data cleaning steps like removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats (e.g., date, currency).
- Data Enrichment: Integrate metadata (e.g., company details, industry sectors) with financial datasets for better insights.
- Schema Mapping: Transform data into defined schemas (e.g., Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) based on the Data Catalogue and Data Dictionary.
- Aggregation: Aggregate data based on fiscal periods or sectors for historical analysis and forecasting.
